# Ego

Ego is an experimental audio game built with Unity where you play musical notes on your keyboard. 
Tom and Jenna are having a tense conversation. Play the right notes to steer the conversation.

## Installation

Download the builds folder and you can play Ego.exe

You can also go to the development branch where you can find the Unity project. 

## Features

Contains a unique but simple branching dialogue system. I believe this system is expandable to include subtitling. As the picture below, you should have designed a structure of dialogues and place them in the appropriate place. Every dialogue line is a number in a conversation.
